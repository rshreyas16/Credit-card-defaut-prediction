# Credit-card-defaut-prediction

The purpose of this project is to conduct quantitative analysis on credit card default risk by using  machine learning algorithm with accessible customer data.

## Dataset source
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit limit, history of payments, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

## Project Overview

The analysis consists of :

1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
2. Machine Learning Modeling.

Machine learning models used are:
Logistic Regression 
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbour
Support vector machine
Naive bayes
XGboost
Decision tree 

## Key findings:
1. Males have more delayed payment than females in this dataset. Keep in mind that this finding only applies to this dataset.
2. Customers with higher education have less default payments and higher credit limits.
3. There appears to be no correlation between default payment and marital status.
